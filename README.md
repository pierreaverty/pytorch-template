# Pytorch Project Template

## Description
This is a deep learning project template using **PyTorch**. It provides a clear and reusable structure to organise data, models, and code for your projects.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/deep-learning-template.git
   cd deep-learning-template```
2.	Install the required dependencies:
	```bash
	pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1.	Prepare your dataset and place it in the data/raw/ directory.
2.	Model weights will be saved in the checkpoints/ directory after each training epoch.
3.	View the training and validation plots in the plots/ directory.

## Project Structure
•	data/: Contains raw and preprocessed data.
•	src/: Contains source code for loading data, defining models, and training/evaluating.
•	checkpoints/: Stores saved model weights.
•	plots/: Stores training and evaluation plots (e.g. loss, accuracy curves, sample predictions).
